# SmartPortSD Adapter

An open hardware adapter designed by [hexbus](https://github.com/hexbus) to connect the [SmartPort SD Nano Shield](https://github.com/djtersteegc/smartportsd/tree/main/smartportsd-nano-shield) by [@djtersteegc](https://github.com/djtersteegc) to Apple II systems using the 19-pin (DB19/DE-19) SmartPort interface.

## Overview

The SmartPort SD Nano Shield is a compact and powerful SmartPort-based SD card solution for Apple II computers. While the original board uses a 25-pin Duodisk connector, it also includes a more accessible 9-pin header that can be repurposed for DB19-compatible systems.

This adapter bridges the 9-pin connector on the SmartPort SD Nano Shield to a DE-19 connector suitable for direct connection to an Apple IIGS or Apple IIc.

## Why This Adapter?

While the SmartPort SD Nano Shield is designed with flexibility in mind, most Apple II users (especially Apple IIGS and IIc owners) need a DE-19 port for SmartPort functionality. This adapter enables direct plug-and-play connectivity using the 9-pin header, eliminating the need for custom cables or bulky DB25 adapters.

Tested and confirmed working on an Apple IIGS. It should also work with the Apple IIc, but please verify pinout compatibility before use.
